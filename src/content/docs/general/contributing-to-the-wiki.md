## Embedding Images
Copy your image into your clipboard (make sure it's the image itself and not just a link to the image) then use ctrl+v to paste it directly into the wiki page you're editing. A text based loading bar should appear, and once it has completed it should be replaced with a github link, and you should be able to see the image in preview.
