## Download NVIDIA SDKManager on the Host Computer

Download the proper version for your host system here: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager

You may have to make a NVIDIA developer account prior to this

I used Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS so I installed the `.deb` version, for that run `sudo apt install -f ./sdkmanager_*.deb`

Make sure `tlp` is not installed on your system!!! For some reason it breaks the flashing.

## Boot the Jetson in recovery mode
