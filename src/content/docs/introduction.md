### Why should I join MRover Software?
* MRover gives you the opportunity to work on an interesting project that spans many fields of study. In fact, MRover is arguably the most interdisciplinary project team in the Wilson Center.
* You will learn skills that are incredibly useful in industry and life. Many of these skills are unattainable through classwork.
* You get to meet and make friends with lots of other students! MRover attracts many interesting, talented people. You can learn a lot from these people if you pay attention, and we're sure we can learn from you too (even if you don't think so right now).
* You can be a part of a team as we compete for a (second) international title.
* You should NOT join if your sole reason is that MRover will look good on your resume.

### What experience do I need to join MRover Software?
* Prior programming experience is not required to join, and we will do our best to help get you up to speed. If you do not have experience with programming languages like C++ or Python, there will be a sizable learning curve ahead of you, but it is manageable.
* Beyond programming languages, learning to use Git for version control is essential for contributing to our codebase. Be sure to read the Git tutorials later on in this wiki!
* Other prior knowledge, such as in robotics or specific fields, can be helpful but is of course not required upon joining.

### What sort of traits and skills do I need to be successful in MRover Software?
A couple critical traits are curiosity and determination. Our senior members will teach, mentor, and provide resources as much as possible, but we also highly encourage you to take the initiative to self-learn. This involves reading and watching tutorials on your own, but especially Googling what you don’t know. That said, it’s important to know when to abandon Google and ask other team members for help. As you spend more time on the team, you will develop a sense of balance between trying to solve problems on your own and seeking help from others.
