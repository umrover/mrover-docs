# What is the role of the Teleoperations team?

The Teleoperations (Teleop) team ensures the rover's physical systems are easily controllable by a human operator. We build and maintain key systems that allow operators to command the rover and receive feedback in real time.

## Base Station GUI

The Base Station GUI is a Vue.js web app that serves as the main interface for operating the rover. It:

- Captures controller inputs (Xbox, Thrustmaster joystick)
- Displays GPS, camera, and sensor data
- Sends waypoints to auton
- Controls devices used in science sample acquisition

and more...

## FastAPI Backend

To support the frontend, we have a Python FastAPI backend that bridges the GUI to ROS2. It:

- Maintains WebSocket connections per subsystem (arm, drive, nav, science, etc.)
- Forwards ROS2 topics to the frontend via msgpack-serialized WebSocket messages
- Publishes controller inputs from the frontend to ROS2 topics
- Stores persistent data like GPS waypoints in SQLite
- Computes robotic arm commands (throttle, IK position, IK velocity)
