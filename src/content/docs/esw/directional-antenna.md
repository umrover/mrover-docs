title: "Directional Antenna"
---
## Context
During the previous year's competition cycle, we struggled with retaining line of sight for communications. We are hoping to improve on this by developing a directional antenna that can track the rover's position and point towards it, helping us retain line of sight as much as possible. This project is currently in the Research and Testing (RAT) stage, so if you are interested, I would recommend going to RAT subteam meetings as they are the ones primarily working on it. Once design has been finalized, this may become a future localization project!
